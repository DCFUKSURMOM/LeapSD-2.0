# LeapSD V2.0
Kicad project files for the LeapSD 2.0 adapter board for Leapfrog devices.

Added a spot for an ESP32 (Designed around the ESP32-WROOM-32E) for Wifi and Bluetooth.

The pull up resistors for the ESP32 are all 10k, there wasn't room to label them

I have no clue if this will work, I'm not that familiar with the ESP32 or the SDIO multiplexer chip I used.

This is completely uncharted territoty for me.

Software trickery may be reqired for everything to work properly, or at all.
